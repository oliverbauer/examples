Show everything which is reachable from Persons up to depth 10, but maximal 200 nodes/edges:
select * from (traverse both() from Person while $depth <= 10) limit 200

Cleanup:
delete vertex from Person
delete vertex from Movie
	  
Show the shortest path from "Terminator: Die Erlösung" to "Matrix (Film)"
SELECT expand(path) FROM (
  SELECT shortestPath($from, $to) AS path 
  LET 
    $from = (SELECT FROM Movie WHERE name='Terminator: Die Erlösung'), 
    $to = (SELECT FROM Movie WHERE name='Matrix (Film)') 
  UNWIND path
)

Another query:

select from (
  traverse both() from (
    select from Person where name = "Bruce Willis"
  ) while $depth <= 3
) limit 2500
