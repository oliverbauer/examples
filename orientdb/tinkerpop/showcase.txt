1.) Start Server (run bin/server.sh) 
2.) Visit http://localhost:2480/studio/index.html#/database/demodb/graph

Show everything which is reachable from Persons up to depth 10, but maximal 200 nodes/edges:
select * from (traverse both() from Person while $depth <= 10) limit 200

Cleanup:
delete vertex from Book
delete vertex from Person
delete vertex from Movie
	  
Show the shortest path from Dean R. Koontz to Bruce Willis:
SELECT expand(path) FROM (
  SELECT shortestPath($from, $to) AS path 
  LET 
    $from = (SELECT FROM Person WHERE name='Dean R. Koontz'), 
    $to = (SELECT FROM Person WHERE name='Bruce Willis') 
  UNWIND path
)

You should get:
Dean R. Koontz                   Vertex-Label: Person
